# The usecase
- This is used to maintain the ci/cd pipeline.

## What is ci/cd:
- A CI/CD pipeline is a series of automated steps that software development teams use to create, test, and deploy applications:
    - Continuous integration (CI):
    Developers frequently merge code changes into a shared repository. This allows for early detection of issues.
    - Continuous delivery (CD) or continuous deployment:
This automates the release of the application to its intended environment. Continuous delivery stops short of automatic production deployment, while continuous deployment automatically releases updates into production.

A CI/CD pipeline is a key part of DevOps, which helps to shorten the software development lifecycle. It can help to: Reduce manual errors, Accelerate software delivery, Improve software quality, and Deliver code changes more frequently and reliably.


Some tools that can be used for CI/CD include:
Jenkins, GitHub actions, CircleCI, TeamCity, GitLab, Bamboo, and Microsoft Azure DevOps.
